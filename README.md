# Problem

In this project, the phrase based model is implemented. A phrase based model is a simple model for machine translation that is based solely on lexical translation, the translation of phrases. This requires a dictionary that maps phrases from one language to another. We first find the alignment of the word. Next, using the bi-text corpus we train the model and calculate the translational probability. Along with the translation probabilities we use the language model to reflect fluency in English.
